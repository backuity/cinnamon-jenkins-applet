Once you've installed it (in your `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets`) you can right click `Configure...` on the applet and fill
in the jenkins URL.

You can filter the whole Jenkins job list by entering a regular expression matching one or several projects.

For example: (PROJET_A-*)|PROJECT_B

Here you can see a snapshot of the configuration panel:
